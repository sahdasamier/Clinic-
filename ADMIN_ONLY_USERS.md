2. ❌ **RegisterPage component** - Deleted completely  
3. ❌ **"Register here" link** - Removed from login page

2. **Navigate to Admin Panel** → Users Management tab
3. **Click "Add User"** button
4. **Fill in user details:**
   - First Name, Last Name
   - Email address
   - Role (management, doctor, receptionist)
   - Select clinic
5. **Generate secure password** (or enter manually)
6. **Create user account** - real Firebase Auth account is created
7. **Share credentials securely** with the user

## 🔒 **Security Benefits**

- ✅ **Controlled access** - Only authorized admins can create accounts
- ✅ **No unauthorized registrations** - Prevents spam/unwanted accounts
- ✅ **Role-based assignment** - Admin assigns appropriate roles

### **For End Users:**
- **Login page shows:** "Contact your administrator for account access"

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Create test user first** to verify functionality
2. **Use strong generated passwords** (12+ characters)
3. **Share credentials securely** (not via email/SMS)
4. **Document user roles** for proper assignment
5. **Click "Fix Access"** if users can't login after creation

## 🔄 **Migration Notes**
